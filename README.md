# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

 ## Author
Jacob Martinez

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech’s number base conversion utility. This program utilizes division and subtraction base conversion methods, and can display the most common base representations of a given number. 

## Build Instructions
‘‘‘bash
gcc -o convert convert .c main .c
./ convert
‘‘‘

## Test Results
147/147 tests passed

## Notes
Due to the small amount of code in this assignment, I combined the implementation and the testing into one file for better readability and file management.
